### game
you receive a hidden String of random  Colors and make a guess of colors (same quantity as the given String). \
You get told how many of the colors are in the right position and how many are present in the String but not at the position you guessed.\
Unlike Wordle you don't get any information as to which colors are in the correct position nor which are present in the String.\
